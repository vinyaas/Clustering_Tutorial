    "**Metrics Used in K-Means**\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means is a widely used unsupervised machine learning algorithm for clustering data. The metrics used in K-Means are essential to evaluate the quality of the clustering results. Here are the most common metrics used in K-Means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inertia**: Inertia is the sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center. It is a measure of how well the data points fit into their assigned clusters.\n",
    "2. **Silhouette Score**: The Silhouette Score is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The range of the Silhouette Score is from -1 to 1.\n",
    "3. **Calinski-Harabasz Index**: The Calinski-Harabasz Index is a measure of the ratio of between-cluster variance to within-cluster variance. A higher value indicates better clustering.\n",
    "4. **Davies-Bouldin Index**: The Davies-Bouldin Index is a measure of the similarity between each pair of clusters based on their centroid distances and scatter within the clusters.\n",
    "5. **Homogeneity Score**: The Homogeneity Score measures the proportion of samples in each cluster that belong to a single class.\n",
    "6. **Completeness Score**: The Completeness Score measures the proportion of samples of each class that are assigned to a single cluster.\n",
    "7. **V-Measure Score**: The V-Measure Score is a measure of the harmonic mean of homogeneity and completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Sales Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a sample sales data with 100 customers, each with the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Age**: The customer's age\n",
    "* **Income**: The customer's annual income\n",
    "* **Purchase Amount**: The amount the customer spent on their last purchase\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to cluster these customers into 3 clusters using K-Means.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inertia**\n",
    "\n",
    "The inertia of the clustering result is 10.0, which means that the sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center is 10.0. This indicates that the data points are relatively close to their assigned cluster centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Silhouette Score**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Silhouette Score of the clustering result is 0.5, which means that the data points are moderately similar to their own cluster compared to other clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calinski-Harabasz Index**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Calinski-Harabasz Index of the clustering result is 1000.0, which means that the ratio of between-cluster variance to within-cluster variance is high. This indicates that the clusters are well-separated and distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Davies-Bouldin Index**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Davies-Bouldin Index of the clustering result is 0.5, which means that the similarity between each pair of clusters is moderate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Homogeneity Score**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Homogeneity Score of the clustering result is 0.8, which means that 80% of the samples in each cluster belong to a single class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Completeness Score**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Completeness Score of the clustering result is 0.9, which means that 90% of the samples of each class are assigned to a single cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**V-Measure Score**\n",
    "\n",
    "The V-Measure Score of the clustering result is 0.85, which means that the harmonic mean of homogeneity and completeness is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these metrics, we can gain the following insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data points are relatively close to their assigned cluster centers, indicating good clustering quality.\n",
    "* The clusters are moderately similar to each other, indicating some overlap between clusters.\n",
    "* The clusters are well-separated and distinct, indicating good clustering quality.\n",
    "* The samples in each cluster belong to a single class, indicating good homogeneity.\n",
    "* The samples of each class are assigned to a single cluster, indicating good completeness.\n",
    "* The harmonic mean of homogeneity and completeness is high, indicating good overall clustering quality.\n",

    "**Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these ranges, you can interpret the results of your clustering model as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the inertia is low (e.g., <10) and the Silhouette Score is high (e.g., >0.7), the model is likely to be excellent.\n",
    "* If the Calinski-Harabasz Index is high (e.g., >10) and the Davies-Bouldin Index is low (e.g., <0.5), the model is likely to be excellent.\n",
    "* If the Homogeneity Score, Completeness Score, and V-Measure Score are all high (e.g., >0.9), the model is likely to be excellent.\n",
    "* If the metrics are moderate (e.g., Silhouette Score between 0.5 and 0.7, Calinski-Harabasz Index between 5 and 10), the model is likely to be good.\n",
    "* If the metrics are poor (e.g., inertia >100, Silhouette Score <0.3, Calinski-Harabasz Index <1), the model is likely to be poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these are general guidelines, and the interpretation of the metrics may vary depending on the specific problem and dataset.\n",
