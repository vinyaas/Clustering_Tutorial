    "**Hyperparameter Tuning for DBSCAN**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning is the process of selecting the best combination of hyperparameters for a machine learning algorithm to achieve optimal performance. In the case of DBSCAN, there are two main hyperparameters that need to be tuned: `eps` and `min_samples`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eps (Îµ)**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Eps` is the maximum distance between two points in a cluster. It is a critical hyperparameter that determines the density of the clusters. A small value of `eps` will result in more clusters, while a large value will result in fewer clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Min_Samples**\n",
    "\n",
    "`min_samples` is the minimum number of points required to form a dense region. It is another critical hyperparameter that determines the density of the clusters. A small value of `min_samples` will result in more noise points, while a large value will result in fewer noise points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyperparameter Tuning Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several hyperparameter tuning techniques that can be used for DBSCAN, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grid Search**: This involves creating a grid of possible hyperparameter values and evaluating the performance of the algorithm for each combination of hyperparameters.\n",
    "2. **Random Search**: This involves randomly sampling the hyperparameter space and evaluating the performance of the algorithm for each combination of hyperparameters.\n",
    "3. **Bayesian Optimization**: This involves using a probabilistic approach to search for the optimal hyperparameters.\n",
    "4. **Gradient-Based Optimization**: This involves using gradient descent to optimize the hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "The best approach for hyperparameter tuning for DBSCAN is to use a combination of grid search and random search. Grid search can be used to identify the optimal range of hyperparameters, and random search can be used to refine the search within that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to perform hyperparameter tuning for DBSCAN using grid search and random search:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN\n",
    "from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate a sample dataset\n",
    "X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=200, centers=4, cluster_std=0.8, random_state=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the hyperparameter grid\n",
    "param_grid = {\n",
    "    'eps': np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 10),\n",
    "    'in_samples': np.linspace(5, 20, 10)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform grid search\n",
    "grid_search = GridSearchCV(DBSCAN(), param_grid, cv=5, scoring='silhouette')\n",
    "grid_search.fit(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the best hyperparameters and the corresponding score\n",
    "print(\"Best Hyperparameters:\", grid_search.best_params_)\n",
    "print(\"Best Score:\", grid_search.best_score_)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform random search\n",
    "random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(DBSCAN(), param_grid, cv=5, scoring='silhouette', n_iter=10)\n",
    "random_search.fit(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the best hyperparameters and the corresponding score\n",
    "print(\"Best Hyperparameters:\", random_search.best_params_)\n",
    "print(\"Best Score:\", random_search.best_score_)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, we first generate a sample dataset using the `make_blobs` function from scikit-learn. We then define the hyperparameter grid using the `param_grid` dictionary. The `param_grid` dictionary specifies the range of values for the `eps` and `min_samples` hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then perform grid search using the `GridSearchCV` class from scikit-learn. The `GridSearchCV` class takes the `DBSCAN` algorithm, the `param_grid` dictionary, and the `cv` parameter as input. The `cv` parameter specifies the number of folds to use for cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then perform random search using the `RandomizedSearchCV` class from scikit-learn. The `RandomizedSearchCV` class takes the `DBSCAN` algorithm, the `param_grid` dictionary, and the `cv` parameter as input. The `n_iter` parameter specifies the number of random searches to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we print the best hyperparameters and the corresponding score for both grid search and random search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of hyperparameter tuning for DBSCAN include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Improved clustering performance\n",
    "* Better handling of noise and outliers\n",
