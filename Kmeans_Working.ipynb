    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we used K-Means clustering to segment a set of customers based on their age, income, and purchase amount. We scaled the data using StandardScaler, initialized the KMeans model with 3 clusters, and fit the model to the scaled data. We then used the cluster labels to segment the customers and identified the characteristics of each segment using the cluster centers. The results can be used to tailor marketing efforts to each segment and improve customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their demographic and behavioral characteristics.\n",
    "* Use the cluster labels to identify the characteristics of each segment and tailor marketing efforts accordingly.\n",
    "* Use the cluster centers to identify the most important features driving the clustering results.\n",
    "* Consider using other clustering algorithms, such as Hierarchical Clustering or DBSCAN, to compare results and identify the best approach for the specific problem.\n",
    "* Consider using dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA or t-SNE, to reduce the number of features and improve the clustering results.\n",

    "**K-Means Attributes**\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-Means algorithm has several attributes that are used to describe the clustering results. These attributes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **labels_**: This attribute contains the cluster labels assigned to each data point. The labels are integers ranging from 0 to k-1, where k is the number of clusters.\n",
    "2. **cluster_centers_**: This attribute contains the coordinates of the cluster centers. The cluster centers are the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster.\n",
    "3. **inertia_**: This attribute contains the sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center. This is also known as the within-cluster sum of squares.\n",
    "4. **n_iter_**: This attribute contains the number of iterations run by the algorithm.\n",
    "5. **n_clusters**: This attribute contains the number of clusters used in the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theoretical Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-Means algorithm works by minimizing the sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center. This is known as the within-cluster sum of squares. The algorithm starts by initializing the cluster centers randomly, and then iteratively updates the cluster centers and assigns each data point to the closest cluster center.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **labels_** attribute contains the cluster labels assigned to each data point. These labels are used to identify which cluster each data point belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **cluster_centers_** attribute contains the coordinates of the cluster centers. These cluster centers are the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster. The cluster centers are updated at each iteration of the algorithm, and they converge to the optimal solution as the algorithm iterates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **inertia_** attribute contains the sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center. This is a measure of the quality of the clustering results. A lower value of inertia indicates that the data points are closer to their cluster centers, and therefore the clustering results are better.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **n_iter_** attribute contains the number of iterations run by the algorithm. This is a measure of how many times the algorithm iterated before converging to the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **n_clusters** attribute contains the number of clusters used in the algorithm. This is a user-specified parameter that determines how many clusters the algorithm should identify.\n",
