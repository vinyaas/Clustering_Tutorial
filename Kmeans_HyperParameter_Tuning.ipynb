    "**Hyperparameter Tuning in K-Means**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning is the process of selecting the best set of hyperparameters for a machine learning model. In the case of K-Means clustering, the hyperparameters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number of clusters (k)**: The number of clusters to form.\n",
    "2. **Initialization method**: The method used to initialize the centroids (e.g., random, k-means++).\n",
    "3. **Distance metric**: The distance metric used to measure the distance between data points and centroids (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).\n",
    "4. **Maximum number of iterations**: The maximum number of iterations to run the algorithm.\n",
    "5. **Tolerance**: The tolerance for convergence (e.g., the minimum change in the centroids).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Techniques for Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several techniques used to determine the optimal hyperparameters for K-Means clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grid Search**: A brute-force approach that involves trying all possible combinations of hyperparameters and selecting the best one.\n",
    "2. **Random Search**: A randomized approach that involves trying a random subset of hyperparameters and selecting the best one.\n",
    "3. **Cross-Validation**: A technique that involves splitting the data into training and testing sets and evaluating the model on the testing set.\n",
    "4. **Bayesian Optimization**: A probabilistic approach that involves modeling the relationship between the hyperparameters and the performance of the model.\n",
